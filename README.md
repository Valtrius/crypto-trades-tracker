<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

* Install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/)
* Install PyQt6: `pip install pyqt6`
* Run `cd source && python main.py`

## Usage

Add trades using the `Add Trade` button.

![Add Trade][add-trade]

Once a trade is added, it goes in your `Trade History`, which you can filter based on pair, or reorder with column headers.

![Trade History][trade-history]

In the Trade History, you can edit trades by double-clicking on a row.

![Edit Trade][edit-trade]

Selecting rows and pressing `Delete` will allow you to delete one or more trades.

In the `Positions` table, you will see your positions based on the trades you've entered.

![Positions][positions]

It allows you to see your current realised PnL for each pair, and the remaining quantity in the position.

Like the `Trades History`, you can filter based on pair or column, but you also can hide the closed positions.
